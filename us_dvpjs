// Main features: Numbers are in shift position (like French), symbols have been
// placed in locations that give good hand-alternation and finger rolling with
// symbols that usually follows, accented characters are possible for I18N,
// and AltGr allows vim motions.
// Patch suggestions should be sent upstream.
